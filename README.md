# FoodBanksinBuffalo
A list and map of some of the food banks located in Buffalo, NY. This project is deployed on AWS here http://34.212.90.59/ . This project is deployed on AWS and uses Nginx as a reverse proxy, the Java Spring web framework, Postgres, the JavaScript library Leaflet, and has wide test coverage. I don't have a domain for the website so unfortunately the website address is an IP address. The website may show as "not secure" on some browsers because I don't have a TLS certificate for https (the site ues http rather than https.)
